title: Devs, Get Yourself A Mentor
date: "2017-10-07"
description: What a Junior Developer really needs for Christmas can’t just be found under the Christmas tree like the latest Star Wars lego sets (but I will take a set off your hands if there’s extra). No it’s more than that and can take many different forms. What is needed is “Support” but what does that mean?

Let’s be real here, it doesn’t matter if you’re a first year JR dev or a crazy ten year Javascript wizard with a +5 to intellect cloak, you should have a mentor.

Everyone can benefit from working with someone they admire or are more skilled than themselves. The fact you look up to this person in some facet means they have accomplished something you would love to mirror. Whether it’s their JavaScript mastery or how they juggle the responsibility of being a team lead while keeping a good work-life balance, there’s just something special about them.

## Clear Benefits Of Getting A Mentor
Lets review some of the ways having a mentor can be beneficial to your growth:

- **Pair Programming:** Are you having a frustrating bug plaguing your pull request? Do you believe that there may be a better way to write a particular component? One thing that’s for sure is I’ve found that my development skill set rises to a whole new level when I’ve been working side by side with a mentor. I believe this for a number of reasons. For instance I have to put thought into how I approach a problem or feature so I can reasonably justify my development process. Another advantage I’ve run across is that I pick up new tricks of the trade when working with someone with a deeper understanding of the toolset than myself.
- **Sage Advice:** Mentors have often blazed a trail that we as apprentices would love to mimic. Frequently when trying to do the same thing they have done but in doing so we often encounter a number of pitfalls and twists in the road which many times end up with us forging our own path. There is nothing wrong with that. Just because we end up somewhere different or chose to do a contrasting decision, doesn’t make it bad. In fact, this is a perfect time to always be reevaluating with your mentor so you’re always working towards the most desired result along with our end game goals.
- **Expands Network:** When working with a mentor you’re often introduced to new people and situations that you may have not otherwise encountered. This could be previous colleagues of your mentor or even a local development focused meetup. This provides a great opportunity to network with others outside your comfort zone and expand your personal experience. Networking is an important facet of any career and can play to your advantage down the road in unforeseen ways.
- **Accountability:** One of my personal favorite reasons for having a mentor is being accountable to someone I respect and admire. When you are honest with your mentor about your goals, you can develop an action plan together. This allows you both to come up with assignments for you to accomplish with a set timeline and to be held to a standard. There is nothing that beats the feeling of checking off a task and reflecting on the battle won with someone you look up to.

## Where Can You Find A Mentor
The chances are pretty good that you already know someone who is executing and performing on the level you wish to be at, in which I would encourage you to approach them for a mentorship. A simple honest conversation can go a long way.

However, in the event you are looking for someone to help guide you as a mentor can, check out a few of these places:

- **Meetups:** Go to Meetup.com and check out a local development meetup that pertains towards your given programming language of choice and collaborate with those you find there. Talk to people, ask about their backgrounds, and show genuine interest in where they are going. Chances are you will find someone there you can learn something from!
- **Your Office:** If you are lucky enough to work around many other developers at your office, go pick their brains! Find out if they are working with the technologies you are interested in, ask about their personal projects because there won’t be anything easier than fishing for mentors in the same pond you visit Monday through Friday! This is exactly where I’ve found some of my closest mentors to me. The ones who’ve made the most impact on me and my career!
- **Someone Else’s Office:** Are you envious of where your buddy works and all the intelligent people they get to work with? I would highly recommend going out with them and some of their coworkers for coffee or a beer! Networking goes such a long way and it’s worth the effort!
- **Local Coworking Spaces:** I highly recommend searching out the local coworking spaces in your city. They’re like a melting pot of remote working talent! In fact, I’ve found some great tutors and mentors from my hometown, Mesh Coworking.
- **Online Communities:** Being a developer, you’ve likely joined a online community at some point, whether it be Stack Overflow, a programming subreddit like /r/reactjs, or even FreeCodeCamp. There are all kinds of online tribes you can join to further your skillset and find mentors. Take advantage of it!
- **Through Your Support Network, Colleagues/Friends/Family:** Asking people close to you for help locating career driven successful mentors can bring unexpected results, both good and bad. However, when you are looking for that extra push, it never hurts to roll the dice!
