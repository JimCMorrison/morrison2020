As many of us plan to congregate around the slightly overcooked turkey this Thanksgiving surrounded by family and friends from end to end, often times the topic of what we are thankful for comes to light.

Now when your turn comes around and you find yourself mid-speech being thankful for your favorite Game Of Thrones character still being alive, be sure to stop and give thanks for great React tutorials as well.

Here are a few that I will be sure to name when my turn comes around that have given me tremendous help when undertaking learning React these past couple months.

## 1. [Facebook’s Intro To React Tutorials](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Of course we have to start off with Facebook’s Intro To React tutorials.

It’s these basic examples that allowed me to really get me a small taste of what React is as you build a simple tic-tac-toe game.

If you have 10 minutes, go give it a shot and put together your own tic-tac-toe board, as you learn about building basic components and props. Truly a perfect start for any beginner!

**Cost:** Free
**Tutorial Length:** 10 minutes

## 2. [Wes Bos’s React For Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/)

Here I was lucky enough to have the office pick up the Master Course of React for Beginners taught by Wes Bos and what a treat this training was.

This course was my introduction to Wes Bos and his incredible teaching style, which helped lead me in the deep dive into React as we built an interactive seafood menu.

As I built the project through his well thought out online training videos, I fell in love with React even more as I learned more about PropTypes and React Router.

While this is the most expensive tutorial on the list, it’s definitely worth every penny!

**Cost:** $95 minimum
**Tutorial Length:** 5 hours

## 3. Modern React With Redux, Stephen Grider’s Udemy Course

Next, I found the Modern React With Redux Udemy course from Stephen Grider and was blown away!

Stephen’s lessons take you from the very beginning of learning React and explains every aspect along the way as you start on your first project together, building a YouTube clone.

With such a small cost of entry on the course, it pays 10x over in the experience you gain from working with React and Redux.

**Cost:** $15 minimum, ranges as with any Udemy courses
**Tutorial Length:** 26.5 hours

And have a Happy Thanksgiving!
