Being an apprentice when it comes to the school of programming myself, I’ve found there are many resources that can really help you further your development skill set.

I’ve worked in the tech industry for the past ten years in one facet or another whether building desktops and servers for a small local computer repair shop to working as a QA Engineer for large educational catered website and always seemed to dream of one day becoming a Web Developer. As time goes on I continue to pursue this goal rigorously and I’ve found that these resources listed below have aided me in my quest.

While this is not an exhaustive list on what can aid you in your path in becoming a seasoned Developer (or Code Jedi for the Star Wars inclined), it does help for those who cannot afford to spend $17,000 dollars on a Code Bootcamp or those who don’t have interest in going into crippling debt to pursue a Computer Science degree.

So grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the scroll.

## 1.Codeschools
The group at TeamTreehouse have put together a vast collection of videos, courses, and workshops with laser like precision to help aspiring developers such as myself and others achieve what they dream. Their courses range subjects like Ruby On Rails, the latest Javascript frameworks, to even Swift and Android development. TreeHouse has even compiled “Tracks” together which consist of multiple courses to help train their members in entire subjects they’re interested in. The instructors they have chosen to lead each course beam with knowledge and show a excitement for what they are teaching.

Any time spent on TeamTreehouse’s website is time well spent.

## 2. Podcasts
Whether I’m trying to speed up a 5K run on a treadmill or trekking through my daily commute to the office, one thing is for certain a podcast is playing. I must admit I was a late starter when jumping on to the podcast bandwagon but when I was shown the StartUp podcast from Gimlet Media, I was hooked. The unique perspective of a Alex Blumberg driven to leave his well paid job in seek of creating his own start up is a emotional story that can tug at your heartstrings. I used that momentum to explore other technology based podcasts and that’s when I found Jonathan Cutrell’s Developer Tea. Jon’s quick 15–30 minute segments journaling latest tech trends, programming concepts, and developer interviews quenched a thirst I was looking for.

I encourage you to explore what podcasts that are out there for you that can benefit your understanding and give you insight that way you too are able to make the most use of that often brief mental downtime in your commute or when you’re doing the dishes.

## 3. Video Tutorials
In this day and age, it’s easier than ever to get started or learn about a concept when you have access to resources such as YouTube. While it may contain a wealth of cat videos, if you search closely enough you can find videos other developers have made that can really shed some light on the latest programming technologies and methodologies out there through tutorials, screencasts, and interviews.

In fact, it’s when I was searching for such content when I ran across MacKenzie Child’s awe inspiring collection of Ruby on Rails focused tutorial videos. Gorging on his tastefully done screencasts eventually lead me to another YouTube development star Travis Neilson of Dev Tips which is an terrific source of information for anyone looking to be better at web design and development.

When you get right down to it there are a lot of inspiring people on YouTube giving away a lot of great information for free, take advantage of it!

## 4. Contibute to Open Source Software
Ask any seasoned developer and the one constant that will remain the same when asking how to start your career as a JR developer is “Contribute to Open Source”. It’s that shared mentality when engaging the community that’s so refreshing, everyone wants to row forward together.
If you navigate to such holy domains like github.com you are able to quickly find a plethora of public projects to add your 2 cents on through a pull request or “PR” for short. The best part is that your addition shows up in your commit history if your PR is merged into the project which is terrific when building a Portfolio!

## 5. Build a Portfolio!
Just like an artist, every developer needs to have a portfolio of their work. A great first step in this could be establishing your own personal portfolio/blog webpage out there on the wild wild internet. Maybe you can even be lucky enough to snag your name as a domain. Start building a repository on GitHub and pulling together your current and past development projects, work history, and content you’ve been publishing for a terrific quick look at who you are and what your about. This is where it’s imperative to use social media to promote your work, build your brand, and get your name out there!

Keep at it and put the work in. It won’t happen quickly but you’ll gain a following as you go along working on perfecting your craft.

## 6.Coworking spaces
If you aren’t spending time at your local coworking space then you are truly missing out.
Coworking offices are the trenches that many great tech related ideas are being executed on! That being the case it gives you the terrific melting pot to meet new people who may already be well versed in a career path you are hoping to pursue and you might just gain a mentor out of it. It also gives you a chance to get all those questions that arise from your personal development projects answered. Another fantastic opportunity of going to a coworking space is getting involved in what others are doing and helping out anyway you can, whether that means writing a couple RSpec tests or doing some black box testing.

I know from my experience with my local cowork Mesh it has made me better with the team there hosting multiple programming meetups a month and providing a friendly atmosphere to learn in!

## 7. Developer meetups
Exploring the local programming meetups are a terrific way to expand your knowledge, showcase your latest work, land a job lead, or even network with some local talent.

Are you comfortable with a certain language? Give a talk at the meetup. Most meetup organizers are always looking for presenters. This will help not only those less experienced but can be used a ice breaker for the group as well as concreting your own knowledge on the subject. If you’re lucky enough to have an technology fluent coworking space in your town perhaps they can help point you in the direction of the next programming focused meetup. I’ve even seen some cases of software companies hosting their own meetups and if you’re still struggling to find a lead, try using meetup.com which is a great source for finding such events.

## 8. Mentors
Finding a mentor in your field of study who cares about you and what you are learning is one of the greatest benefits to building career as a developer. Whether the person you find works with you, lives in the same city, or visits the same meetups they can be a valuable person to bounce ideas off of or pair programing with.

Keep in mind as your relationship with your mentor grows just as any other personal relationship does, it’s important to give and not always take. This can mean buying them lunch periodically or going out of your way to help them in a facet in which you are able. It’s also important that you be comfortable leaning on your mentor when you have questions that you are unable to find the answers to. I personally struggled with this and have found it’s better to ask and have another set of eyes look at the problem rather than to drain away valuable time scouring the ends of the internet looking for an obscure answer.

I have been fortunate to find great mentors such as Dustin McCraw and David Patrick who are both thriving web developers and all around great people. They bring tremendous value as mentors as I embark on my career and personal life. I continue to be very thankful for their patience with me as I continue to grow as a junior web developer.

## 9.Pair Programming
There is something so powerful about working together with a seasoned developer during a pair programming session. Whether it’s the laser like focus in breaking down a problem or the insight when developing a solution, it’s remarkably potent.

If you’re lucky enough to have snagged a mentor or know a patient developer, pair programming is a terrific exercise to participate in together. It’s where I’ve learned some of the more difficult programming concepts while sitting copilot. In fact, I feel I learn so much from this type of training that I work with Nick Muller from Mesh CoWork every week to further my skillset!

## 10. Publish what you’re learning!
Put the pen to paper, text to the screen, screencast to YouTube, and publish what you’re learning about! Did you just learn about Active Record when studying Ruby on Rails? Write a Medium article about it and give your perspective on how it works and how it can be used to benefit others! You just spent the past month working in AngularJS? Put together a screencast teaching the fundamentals and post it to YouTube!

Take the real feedback you get from what’ve published and learn from it. Again make sure you use social media to promote your work and get your brand out there. Not only does this help propel yourself forward and better learn the subject but it helps other learn and gain traction as well!

## 11. Practice! Practice! Practice!
It should be obvious, practice is by far the most important piece of learning something new or trying to perfect a technique. There are no short cuts through practice but putting the time in and honing your craft! You need those Git commits on your personal development projects like you need air!

Maybe go as far as to challenge yourself to do one code exercise a day on CodeWars.com. If you have a busy schedule I can understand it can be hard to overcome, hell I have two daughters who are two months and 18 months but don’t stop trying! It’s imperative for you to achieve your goals to not let your busy schedule bury you down into stagnation like a tar pit.
Instead try getting up an extra hour early to practice or maybe commit to a specific time where you can spare even 45 minutes of uninterrupted time, I know you can find it if you look hard enough!

*“Effort is grossly underrated.” — Gary Vaynerchuk*

Honestly at the end of the day, if you want to be better at a particular subject, do more of it! Want to be a better writer? Then write more! Want to program with the best of them? Then program more! Want to be a master Chef? Get your ass in the kitchen and start cooking with new ingredients!

Be the best you you can be, want it for yourself and your family! Don’t make excuses, they are always easy to find. Just shut the fuck up and do it! Let what you do and accomplish echo through the halls!

## 12. Don’t give up!
During your journey into becoming a developer there will be many points where you are wrapped with frustration, anger, sadness, or even depression.

It’s only natural as you continue to progress and challenge yourself to feel these emotions but don’t stop! It’s easy to give up, it doesn’t take any effort to give up. However you don’t want easy, you want something more. Why settle for being average? Push yourself and get used to being uncomfortable because when you look back a year from now when you first started climbing that mountain, you’ll be amazed at the distance you’ve traveled. It’s going to be hard but if you want it bad enough I promise it will be worth it!
