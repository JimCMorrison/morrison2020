title: Treat Your GitHub Repos Like Your Monopoly Properties

description: What a Junior Developer really needs for Christmas can’t just be found under the Christmas tree like the latest Star Wars lego sets (but I will take a set off your hands if there’s extra). No it’s more than that and can take many different forms. What is needed is “Support” but what does that mean?

When I was growing up, I spent a lot of time playing Monopoly with my cousins. No matter if we had to convince my aunt to play the banker while the rest of us elementary aged stinky boys haggled for properties and cold hard monopoly cash or we all took turns playing Monopoly on Super Nintendo.

Now as a grown man child, it’s no wonder nostalgia took over and had me downloading the Monopoly app on my iPhone last week. After sinking far too many precious downtime hours into being the Hotel King of the West Coast Pennsylvania Railroad, I made a unique comparison. Github repositories can be similar to Monopoly properties!

How so you may ask?

## Repos/Properties Are Worth The Most When You Invest In Them!

Just like Monopoly properties that you own in the game, the repositories on your Github profile bring the most value to you if you take the time to invest into them!

Your Github profile is your public facing portfolio as a developer. It’s essentially the billboard for promoting the type of developer you are and some of the technologies you work with. You can also see how active a developer is with their personal public facing repos or assisting with open source software by their contribution history graph.

Now don’t be discouraged if your contribution history is minimal like mine. It’s never too late to take on a personal project or help someone else with theirs! We can all grow together!

## Making The Most of Your Properties/Repos You Do Have

Since Github can be seen as the reflection of our current work, it’s important that we keep it up to date and consistant. There’s no problem with doing a little spring cleaning with those old training project repos or picking back up a long forgotten side project to add a fresh new twist on it!

Here is a short list of ideas to freshen up those oldies but goodies:

- **Add Unit Tests**. A fresh set of tests can also help showcase good practices or new skills learned!

- **Expand On Previous Projects Concept**. Put a new twist on your previous side project by giving it a new feature!

- **Fixing An Old Bug**. Fix that nasty CSS that has been plaguing your side app or maybe solve the redirect issue!

## You Don’t Have Any Properties/Repos To Your Name?

In the event you find yourself starting from square one with a fresh Github account and don’t have any projects yet, just jump in and get started!

Here are a couple of reasons to create a fresh repository today!

- **Gain New Experience**. Every new project gives you the opportunity to challenge yourself through building something new that challenges and expands your current skill set.

- **Opportunity For Pair Programming**. Having a new repository on Github gives you a chance to work with someone on a shared vision and tackle an app together. This is a terrific experience for a green developer, as they get a chance to learn what it can be like working with a team on a shared project.

- **Looks Great To Employers**. Whether it be your current employer or a new perspective employer, seeing you’re active in outside projects is always a good sign of a passionate developer.
